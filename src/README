Noke
===========================
Noke name comes from NOde and karaOKE.
I'm trying to implement a karaoke client in Node.js with Socket.io.

Why?
================
- Almost ALL existing NCN karaoke have exactly same format
- I can't code desktop application
- I think I have some cool idea that need to be implemented.

Dependencies
===================
- socket.Io
- express
- iconv
